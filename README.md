# MrRobotWalkthrough
This lab represents a hands-on exercise that implemented a penetration test of an organization's  web application and server. It identified existing and possible vulnerabilities. It also carried out  the actions needed to exploit a specific, high risk vulnerability. This exploitation identified the  risk associated with it and the impact to the system. The methodology used combined the  requirements of footprinting, fingerprinting, enumeration, penetration, access escalation,  maintaining access, and covering tracks. This was incorporated into the cyber-kill chain  methodology to take advantage of the vulnerable box.
